# FundManagerTradingStrategy
Fund managers report their holdings every month. They donâ€™t want to tell investors they lost money on meme stocks. So at the end of the month, they sell low-quality assets and buy high-quality assets, like bonds.  We might be able to take advantage of this by buying bonds at the end of the month and selling them at the beginning of the month.
